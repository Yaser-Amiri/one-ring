# One Ring

**NOTE:  This project was never intended for production use; it serves as an experiment to discover the most suitable interface for CSP on top of AsyncIO and to demonstrate its functionality.**


The main purpose of this library is to facilitate concurrent programming with Asyncio,
to achieve this purpose it will give you basic tools of CSP (like `channel` and `select`),
structured concurrency and of course some sugars for Asyncio.

You can see some samples [here](https://github.com/Yaser-Amiri/one-ring/blob/main/docs/samples.rst).
