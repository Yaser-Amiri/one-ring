# One Ring

The main purpose of this library is to facilitate concurrent programming with Asyncio,
to achieve this purpose it will give you basic tools of CSP (like `channel` and `select`),
structured concurrency and of course some sugars for Asyncio.

You can see some samples [here](https://github.com/Yaser-Amiri/one-ring/blob/main/docs/samples.rst).
